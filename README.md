**Car Price Prediction – Data Science Internship Project**              
Welcome! This project is my hands-on exploration into predicting used car prices using Python and machine learning. It’s both an academic internship assignment and a chance for me to deepen my real-world data science skills.

**About the Project**              
The goal is to predict the selling price of pre-owned cars using features like year, present price, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and owner history. I worked through the whole data science workflow:

Data Cleaning and Understanding

Feature Engineering

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Modeling (Linear Regression, Random Forest)

Evaluation & Visualization

Each step is explained with clear code and markdown in the notebook, so others can follow and learn.

**Highlights & Learnings**             
Explored how factors like present price and car age impact resale value (sometimes in surprising ways!)

Used EDA to visualize relationships and test intuition about important features.

Compared two models: Linear Regression vs. Random Forest—RF performed better for this dataset.

Reflected on modeling, errors, and next steps. Real car pricing can be unpredictable, and the project taught me a lot about working with messy data.

**Files**      
Car_Price_Pridection.ipynb – Main Jupyter notebook (well-documented)

car-data.csv – The clean dataset used throughout

**Getting Started**         
Download or clone this repo to your machine.

Open the notebook in Jupyter or Colab.

Run cells step-by-step (data and code are both included).

Feel free to adjust features or model parameters for deeper analysis!
